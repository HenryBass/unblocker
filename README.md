## Unblock any blocked site!

*This site uses Google Translate as a proxy to access blocked sites, as the first layer.*

This should get through most firewalls.

*Then, it exploits a feature of Securly, tricking it into thinking we're visiting a suicide prevention website.
There's a failsafe for this, and it allowes us through.*

There's probably a legal reason for this. Securly allows you to suicide prevention content, even if the parent site is blocked.

*If you get an error, try again later or use a different site. Not every site works with this.*

Proxy breaks a lot of stuff.
